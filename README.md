INSTRUCTIONS IF YOU ARE USING WSL OR CONTAINERS

If you are using WSL (Windows subsystem for linux) or normal VMS, please follow the instructions given in the PDF. 
This will run the Greenbone OPENVAS on your web browser

The best idea would be to install WSL in windows and download in WSL Ubuntu machine.
Best of Luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
